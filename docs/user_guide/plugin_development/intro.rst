Intro
=====

Before we get started I would like to make sure you have all the
necessary requirements installed and give you an idea of which
knowledge you should already possess in order to follow along
without difficulty.

Requirements
------------

This guide assumes that you've already installed and configured Err
and have successfully managed to connect it to a chatting service
server. See :doc:`/user_guide/setup` if you have not yet managed to
install or start Err.

Prior knowledge
---------------

You can most definitely
work with Err if you only have basic Python knowledge, but you
should know about data structures such as dictionaries, tuples and
lists, know what docstrings are and have a basic understanding of
decorators.

Recommended to implement the tests of you plugin:
`Python <http://pytest.org/>`_.
