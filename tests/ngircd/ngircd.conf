#
# This is a sample configuration file for the ngIRCd IRC daemon, which must
# be customized to the local preferences and needs.
#
# Comments are started with "#" or ";".
#
# A lot of configuration options in this file start with a ";". You have
# to remove the ";" in front of each variable to actually set a value!
# The disabled variables are shown with example values for completeness only
# and the daemon is using compiled-in default settings.
#
# Use "ngircd --configtest" (see manual page ngircd(8)) to validate that the
# server interprets the configuration file as expected!
#
# Please see ngircd.conf(5) for a complete list of configuration options
# and their descriptions.
#

[Global]
	# The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
	# configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
	# on which the server should be listening.
	# These settings depend on your personal preferences, so you should
	# make sure that they correspond to your installation and setup!

	# Server name in the IRC network, must contain at least one dot
	# (".") and be unique in the IRC network. Required!
	Name = irc.gootz.net

	# Information about the server and the administrator, used by the
	# ADMIN command. Not required by server but by RFC!
	;AdminInfo1 = Description
	;AdminInfo2 = Location
	;AdminEMail = admin@irc.server

	# Text file which contains the ngIRCd help text. This file is required
	# to display help texts when using the "HELP <cmd>" command.
	;HelpFile = /usr/share/doc/ngircd/Commands.txt

	# Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and
	# LINKS requests for example.
	Info = Server Info Text

	# Comma separated list of IP addresses on which the server should
	# listen. Default values are:
	# "0.0.0.0" or (if compiled with IPv6 support) "::,0.0.0.0"
	# so the server listens on all IP addresses of the system by default.
	Listen = 127.0.0.1

	# Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will
	# be shown to all users connecting to the server:
	;MotdFile = /etc/ngircd.motd

	# A simple Phrase (<256 chars) if you don't want to use a motd file.
	;MotdPhrase = "Hello world!"

	# The name of the IRC network to which this server belongs. This name
	# is optional, should only contain ASCII characters, and can't contain
	# spaces. It is only used to inform clients. The default is empty,
	# so no network name is announced to clients.
	;Network = aIRCnetwork

	# Global password for all users needed to connect to the server.
	# (Default: not set)
	;Password = abc

	# This tells ngIRCd to write its current process ID to a file.
	# Note that the pidfile is written AFTER chroot and switching the
	# user ID, e.g. the directory the pidfile resides in must be
	# writable by the ngIRCd user and exist in the chroot directory.
	;PidFile = /var/run/ngircd/ngircd.pid

	# Ports on which the server should listen. There may be more than
	# one port, separated with ",". (Default: 6667)
	;Ports = 6667, 6668, 6669

	# of the group or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges!
	;ServerGID = 65534

	# User ID under which the server should run; you can use the name
	# of the user or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges! In addition,
	# the configuration and MOTD files must be readable by this user,
	# otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!
	;ServerUID = 65534

[Limits]
	# Define some limits and timeouts for this ngIRCd instance. Default
	# values should be safe, but it is wise to double-check :-)

	# The server tries every <ConnectRetry> seconds to establish a link
	# to not yet (or no longer) connected servers.
	;ConnectRetry = 60

	# Number of seconds after which the whole daemon should shutdown when
	# no connections are left active after handling at least one client
	# (0: never, which is the default).
	# This can be useful for testing or when ngIRCd is started using
	# "socket activation" with systemd(8), for example.
	;IdleTimeout = 0

	# Maximum number of simultaneous in- and outbound connections the
	# server is allowed to accept (0: unlimited):
	;MaxConnections = 0

	# Maximum number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address
	# the server will accept (0: unlimited):
	;MaxConnectionsIP = 5

	# Maximum number of channels a user can be member of (0: no limit):
	;MaxJoins = 10

	# Maximum length of an user nickname (Default: 9, as in RFC 2812).
	# Please note that all servers in an IRC network MUST use the same
	# maximum nickname length!
	;MaxNickLength = 9

	# Maximum number of channels returned in response to a /list
	# command (0: unlimited):
	;MaxListSize = 100

	# After <PingTimeout> seconds of inactivity the server will send a
	# PING to the peer to test whether it is alive or not.
	;PingTimeout = 120

	# If a client fails to answer a PING with a PONG within <PongTimeout>
	# seconds, it will be disconnected by the server.
	;PongTimeout = 20

[Options]
	# Optional features and configuration options to further tweak the
	# behavior of ngIRCd. If you want to get started quickly, you most
	# probably don't have to make changes here -- they are all optional.

	# List of allowed channel types (channel prefixes) for newly created

	# types are allowed. Set this variable to the empty string to disallow

	# use commands like CONNECT, SQUIT, DIE, ...?
	;AllowRemoteOper = no

	# A directory to chroot in when everything is initialized. It
	# doesn't need to be populated if ngIRCd is compiled as a static
	# binary. By default ngIRCd won't use the chroot() feature.
	# ATTENTION: For this to work the server must have been started
	# with root privileges!
	;ChrootDir = /var/empty

	# Set this hostname for every client instead of the real one.

	# The Salt for cloaked hostname hashing. When undefined a random
	# hash is generated after each server start.

	# Set every clients' user name to their nickname
	;CloakUserToNick = yes

	# Try to connect to other IRC servers using IPv4 and IPv6, if possible.
	;ConnectIPv6 = yes
	;ConnectIPv4 = yes

	# Default user mode(s) to set on new local clients. Please note that
	# only modes can be set that the client could set using regular MODE
	# commands, you can't set "a" (away) for example! Default: none.
	;DefaultUserModes = i

	# Do DNS lookups when a client connects to the server.
	;DNS = yes

	# Do IDENT lookups if ngIRCd has been compiled with support for it.
	# Users identified using IDENT are registered without the "~" character

	# Users identified using PAM are registered without the "~" character
	# prepended to their user name.
	;PAM = yes

	# When PAM is enabled, all clients are required to be authenticated
	# using PAM; connecting to the server without successful PAM
	# authentication isn't possible.
	# If this option is set, clients not sending a password are still
	# allowed to connect: they won't become "identified" and keep the "~"
	# character prepended to their supplied user name.
	# Please note: To make some use of this behavior, it most probably
	# isn't useful to enable "Ident", "PAM" and "PAMIsOptional" at the
	# same time, because you wouldn't be able to distinguish between
	# Ident'ified and PAM-authenticated users: both don't have a "~"
	# character prepended to their respective user names!
	;PAMIsOptional = no

	# Let ngIRCd send an "authentication PING" when a new client connects,
	# and register this client only after receiving the corresponding

	;RequireAuthPing = no

	;ScrubCTCP = no

	# Syslog "facility" to which ngIRCd should send log messages.
	# Possible values are system dependent, but most probably auth, daemon,

	# change this to "daemon", for example.

;[SSL]

[Server]
	# Other servers are configured in [Server] sections. If you

	# for the other server to connect.
	# There may be more than one server block, one for each server.
	#
	# Server Groups:
	# The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
	# server with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a
	# group won't answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server
	# in the given group. But the ngircd never tries to connect to two
	# servers with the same group ID.

	# IRC name of the remote server, must match the "Name" variable in
	# the [Global] section of the other server (when using ngIRCd).

	;PeerPassword = PeerSecret

	# Group of this server (optional)
	;Group = 123

	# Set the "Passive" option to "yes" if you don't want this ngIRCd to
	# connect to the configured peer (same as leaving the "Port" variable
	# empty). The advantage of this option is that you can actually

	;Passive = no

	;SSLConnect = yes

	# Define a (case insensitive) list of masks matching nicknames that

	# (which is the default).
	# When you are connecting IRC services which mask as a IRC server
